# Resources for Tech Conference Speakers

In my mentoring work, I often find myself sending out the same list of speaking resources to aspiring speakers. After facilitating the San Diego edition of Global Diversity CFP Day, I was about to send out the list via email, and thought it would be nice to put it out publicly and under version control so others can share and contribute. And here we are! -April

### I just created this, so please give me some time on the contribution guide. It's coming. :)
